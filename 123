The Evolution of Excellence   卓越的演进
The O’Neil Trading Method 奥尼尔交易法
As portfolio managers who once ran money for William J. O’Neil, we have observed that a meaningful portion of the O’Neil “body of thought” is derived from the philosophies of those who preceded him, particularly the works of Richard Wyckoff and Jesse Livermore. When it comes to market thought, you can never entirely understand Bill O’Neil until you have read and understood these two gentlemen. Obviously, the techniques and philosophies of the famous trader Jesse Livermore, as presented in the classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, by Edwin Lefèvre and Livermore’s own How to Trade in Stocks, figure heavily in the underlying pulse that governs the way Bill O’Neil and his stable of portfolio managers trade. Richard Wyckoff, as one of the first to write about Jesse Livermore in his original work, Jesse Livermore’s Methods of Trading Stocks, espoused much of the common sense investment philosophies and maxims that have found their way into the writings and investment thought of William J. O’Neil. Even Nicolas Darvas, in his famous book,  How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market (Carol Publishing Group, 1998), laid the foundation for O’Neil’s “chart bases” with his own “boxes,” which he described as simply normal consolidation channels within which a stock’s action was judged to be normal or abnormal.
作为曾经为威廉·J·奥尼尔管理资金的投资组合经理，我们观察到，奥尼尔“思想体系”中相当一部分源自前人的理念，尤其是理查德·威科夫和杰西·利弗莫尔的著作。谈到市场思想，如果你没有阅读并理解这两位先生的著作，就永远无法完全理解比尔·奥尼尔。显然，著名交易员杰西·利弗莫尔的技巧和理念，正如埃德温·勒费弗尔在其经典著作《股票作手回忆录》以及利弗莫尔本人所著的《如何交易股票》中所阐述的那样，对比尔·奥尼尔及其投资组合经理团队的交易方式产生了深远的影响。理查德·威科夫是最早撰写杰西·利弗莫尔相关著作的人之一，他在《杰西·利弗莫尔的股票交易方法》一书中阐述了许多常识性的投资理念和格言，这些理念和格言后来也被威廉·J·奥尼尔的著作和投资思想所吸收。甚至尼古拉斯·达瓦斯在他著名的著作《我如何在股市赚到200万美元》（卡罗尔出版集团，1998年）中，也用他自己的“方框”为奥尼尔的“图表基础”奠定了基础。他将这些“方框”简单地描述为正常的盘整通道，股票的走势在这些通道内会被判断为正常或异常。The themes that echo from Wyckoff, Livermore, Darvas, and others weave the essential fabric from which “O’Neil-style” investment methodologies are cut. These methodologies utilized the work of O’Neil’s predecessors by bringing into play the time-tested characteristics of winning stocks that O’Neil painstakingly identified, analyzed, catalogued, and verified in his numerous Model Book Studies, some of which your  authors had the privilege of producing and contributing to. By sifting through the best-performing, institutional-quality leading stocks in each and every type of market cycle, O’Neil identified their key common characteristics, the most basic of which provided the genesis for O’Neil’s unique stock-selection template, commonly known to the investing public as CAN SLIM. Certainly, O’Neil owes a debt to the thinking of Livermore, Wyckoff, and others, and the roots of the O’Neil investment methodologies run deep in this regard. However, as former portfolio managers for William O’Neil + Company, Inc., we can vouch for the fact that such roots do not imply that O’Neil simply copied his predecessors. That would be a gross oversimplification, since the truth is that the O’Neil methodologies took the thinking of these outstanding stock market investors from the past to a much higher level by bringing greater clarity to the process as he formulated a concrete, concise, and practical approach to making money in the stock market.
威科夫、利弗莫尔、达瓦斯等人的思想交织成“奥尼尔式”投资方法论的精髓。这些方法论借鉴了奥尼尔前辈的研究成果，并运用了奥尼尔在其众多模型研究著作中精心识别、分析、整理和验证的成功股票的经受时间考验的特征——其中一些著作的作者有幸参与撰写和贡献。通过筛选每个市场周期中表现最佳的机构级领头羊股票，奥尼尔发现了它们的关键共同特征，其中最基本的特征构成了奥尼尔独特的选股模板的雏形，该模板通常被投资者称为CAN SLIM。毋庸置疑，奥尼尔深受利弗莫尔、威科夫等人思想的影响，奥尼尔投资方法论的根基也深植于此。然而，作为威廉·奥尼尔公司（William O’Neil + Company, Inc.）的前投资组合经理，我们可以保证，这样的背景并不意味着奥尼尔只是简单地复制了他的前辈。这种说法过于简单化，因为事实是，奥尼尔的方法论将这些杰出股票市场投资者的思维方式提升到了一个更高的层次，他通过构建一套具体、简洁且实用的股票市场赚钱方法，使整个过程更加清晰明了。The parallels between O’Neil and his predecessors provide an over-arching backdrop to a general philosophy, a certain ethos, if you will, toward the market that is more than just Livermore’s, or Wyckoff’s, or even O’Neil’s. As O’Neil himself used to tell us, “It’s not MY system. It’s the market’s, because it is based on how the market actually works.” In this manner, O’Neil simply sees his own work as furthering the basic process of understanding the market through observation and the application of common sense rules gained thereby. It is nothing more or less than understanding all the small realities that make up the stock market. Reviewing how O’Neil has taken and expanded upon the works of his predecessors is a useful exercise, and sets the backdrop for much of the research we have done to further our approach to the O’Neil/Livermore/Wyckoff approach to the market, and which is one of the main topics of this book.
奥尼尔与其前辈之间的相似之处，为一种超越利弗莫尔、威科夫甚至奥尼尔个人范畴的市场哲学或理念提供了一个宏观的背景。正如奥尼尔本人常说的：“这不是我的体系，而是市场的体系，因为它基于市场实际的运作方式。” 如此看来，奥尼尔的工作仅仅是通过观察和运用由此获得的常识性规则，进一步推进对市场的理解。这无非就是理解构成股市的所有细微现实。回顾奥尼尔如何吸收并拓展前辈的著作是一项有益的工作，也为我们深入研究奥尼尔/利弗莫尔/威科夫的市场方法奠定了基础，而这正是本书的主要主题之一。



PREPARATION, STUDY, AND PRACTICE 
准备、学习与实践Don’t dabble in stocks. Dig in and do some detective work. 不要浅尝辄止地涉足股票市场。要深入研究，做好功课。
—William O’Neil, How to Make Money in Stocks,  2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995), 34
——威廉·奥尼尔，《如何在股市赚钱》，第二版（纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，1995年），第34页 This the essential premise of O’Neil methodologies: They are in no way, shape, or form intended as a panacea for making money in the market. Human beings are complex organisms, and so represent the greatest variable in the implementation of any investment methodology, whether of “O’Neilian” origin or otherwise. This is why O’Neil insists that one must put in the time, effort, and work required if one intends to become a  successful stock market investor: “Human nature being what it is, 90 percent of the people in the stock market, professionals and amateurs alike, simply haven’t done enough homework.”
这是奥尼尔投资方法论的核心前提：它们绝非股市赚钱的万灵药。人是复杂的生物体，因此，无论投资方法是否源自奥尼尔，人本身都是影响投资效果的最大变数。正因如此，奥尼尔坚持认为，要想成为一名成功的股市投资者，就必须投入必要的时间、精力和努力：“鉴于人性的复杂，股市中90%的人，无论是专业人士还是业余爱好者，都缺乏足够的准备工作。”O’Neil laments the fact that so many investors are looking for some magic formula that enables them to produce an optimal result in the stock market with little or no effort. In The Successful Investor, he laments the “rise of the individual investor” during the dot-com bubble market of 1999. “Most people, both investors and advisors, got hurt in the 2000 to 2002 downturn because they never took the time to learn sound investment rules and principles. In the 90s they thought they’d found a way to make money without doing much homework. They just bought tips, touts, and stories” (William J. O’Neil, The Successful Investor [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004], xii).
奥尼尔感叹，许多投资者都在寻找某种神奇的公式，希望能够毫不费力地在股市中获得最佳收益。在《成功的投资者》一书中，他哀叹1999年互联网泡沫时期“个人投资者的崛起”。“大多数人，包括投资者和顾问，在2000年至2002年的经济衰退中遭受损失，是因为他们从未花时间学习可靠的投资规则和原则。在90年代，他们以为自己找到了一种无需做太多功课就能赚钱的方法。他们只是盲目相信各种内幕消息、吹嘘和故事。”（威廉·J·奥尼尔，《成功的投资者》[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2004年]，第xii页）。While most investors do not hesitate to dabble in the markets, they would rarely dabble in medical or legal practice, or even in playing professional baseball. O’Neil reminds us, however, “Outstanding stockbrokers or advisory services are no more frequent than are outstanding doctors, lawyers, or baseball players” (William O’Neil, How to Make Money in Stocks, 2nd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995], 256). This is not too far off from Richard Wyckoff’s astute observation that “A person becomes competent in other fields because he has generally gone through a long period of practice and preparation. A physician, for example, goes to college, attends medical clinics, rides in an ambulance, serves in hospitals, and after some years of preparatory work, hangs out a sign. In Wall Street, the same M.D. would hang his sign first; then proceed to practice” (Richard Wyckoff,  How I Trade and Invest in Stocks & Bonds [New York: The Magazine of Wall Street, 1924], 159-160).
虽然大多数投资者都乐于涉足股市，但他们很少会涉足医疗或法律领域，甚至很少会去打职业棒球。然而，奥尼尔提醒我们，“杰出的股票经纪人或咨询服务并不比杰出的医生、律师或棒球运动员更常见”（威廉·奥尼尔，《股票致富之道》，第二版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，1995年]，第256页）。这与理查德·威科夫的精辟见解颇为相似：“一个人之所以能在其他领域胜任工作，通常是因为他经历了长期的实践和准备。例如，医生要上大学，参加诊所实习，乘坐救护车，在医院服务，经过几年的准备工作后，才能挂牌行医。而在华尔街，同样的医生会先挂牌行医，然后再开始执业”（理查德·威科夫，《我如何交易和投资股票和债券》[纽约：《华尔街杂志》，1924年]，第159-160页）。Investing is hard work, and an investor requires no less preparation and expertise than any other white shoe professionals practicing their craft, whether it be law, medicine, software design, moviemaking, or otherwise. Jesse Livermore became annoyed when he was approached by friends or acquaintances who would ask him how they, too, could make money in the market. Biting his tongue, Livermore’s answer eventually evolved into a curt, “I don’t know,” as he found it difficult “to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to a man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon: ‘How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?”’ (Jesse Livermore, How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 15).
投资是一项艰苦的工作，投资者所需的准备和专业知识丝毫不亚于其他任何从事法律、医学、软件设计、电影制作或其他行业的专业人士。杰西·利弗莫尔（Jesse Livermore）很反感朋友或熟人问他如何在股市赚钱。他忍住不回答，最终只好简短地说“我不知道”，因为他觉得“很难对这种人保持耐心”。首先，这种问题对一个对投资和投机进行过科学研究的人来说并非赞美。这就像一个外行人问律师或外科医生：“我怎样才能在法律或外科领域快速赚钱？”一样荒谬。（杰西·利弗莫尔，《股票交易之道》（格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991年），第15页）While reminding investors that success can only be achieved by hard work and persistence, O’Neil, always the optimist, makes it plain that success is within the reach of anyone willing to make the effort, and in his book, How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, 9), he urges us all on with a  touch of self-sufficient idealism, “The American dream can be yours if you have the drive and desire and make up your mind to never give up on yourself.” But O’Neil insists from the start that, as Wyckoff wrote, “. . . anybody who thinks he knows of a short-cut that will not involve ‘sweat of the brow’ is sadly mistaken” (How I Trade and Invest in Stocks & Bonds [New York: The Magazine of Wall Street, 1924], 93).
奥尼尔始终乐观，他提醒投资者，成功唯有通过辛勤工作和坚持不懈才能实现。他明确指出，只要肯努力，成功就在眼前。在他的著作《如何在股市赚钱》（2009年，第9页）中，他以一种略带自立理想主义的口吻激励我们：“只要你有动力和渴望，并且下定决心永不放弃，美国梦就能属于你。” 但奥尼尔从一开始就坚持认为，正如威科夫所写的那样，“……任何认为自己知道一条无需‘汗水’就能走捷径的人都大错特错了”（《我如何交易和投资股票和债券》[纽约：华尔街杂志，1924年]，第93页）。



BUY EXPENSIVE—NOT CHEAP—STOCKS 
买入高价股票，而非低价股票Like Livermore, O’Neil despises a lazy approach to the market because it results in one trying to take what is perceived as the easy route to stock market riches. Nowhere else is this more embodied than in the idea of buying stocks that are “cheap.” This age-old trap is easy to fall into, since most novice investors approach the market with an incorrigibly ingrained consumer mentality that views anything selling today at a lower price than it was yesterday as a “bargain.” This is perhaps because the individual investor views herself as a consumer endpoint, when in fact the investor should act like a business that purchases raw or finished goods and intends to turn around and sell them at a higher price. Hence, O’Neil’s story about red dresses and yellow dresses, where the slower-selling yellow dresses are marked down by the store owner to get them out of the “portfolio,” otherwise known as the store inventory, so that more of the hotter-selling red dresses can be purchased and resold at higher prices.
和利弗莫尔一样，奥尼尔也鄙视那种懒散的市场投资方式，因为它会导致人们试图走捷径，走上股市致富之路。而这种想法最能体现这一点的莫过于购买“便宜”股票。这种由来已久的陷阱很容易让人落入，因为大多数新手投资者都带着根深蒂固的消费者心态看待市场，认为今天价格低于昨天的任何东西都是“便宜货”。这或许是因为个人投资者把自己当作最终消费者，而实际上，投资者应该像企业一样，购买原材料或成品，然后以更高的价格转售。因此，奥尼尔讲了一个关于红裙子和黄裙子的故事：店主会把卖得慢的黄裙子降价出售，以便清理库存，从而进货更多畅销的红裙子，并以更高的价格出售。O’Neil advocates buying stocks that are “red dresses” selling “like hotcakes” at all-time high prices. The reason for this is simple: “. . . real leaders start their big moves by selling at new price highs, not near new lows or off a good amount from their highs” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 426). In a contrarian sense, this is what makes the concept of buying stocks at new highs so effective. It is simply not obvious to the crowd, who fear buying a stock that looks to be selling at such a high price, because, as O’Neil points outs, “What seems too high in price and risky to the majority usually goes higher eventually, and what seems low and cheap usually goes lower” (2009, 174). The market tries to fool the majority of investors the majority of the time, so if new high prices in a particular stock make the crowd timid about buying it, then that is likely the precise time to be buying the stock.
奥尼尔提倡买入那些像“红裙子”一样炙手可热、价格创历史新高的股票。原因很简单：“……真正的领导者会在股价创下新高时抛售，而不是在接近新低或距离高点较远时抛售”（《股票投资致富之道》，第四版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009]，426页）。从逆向思维的角度来看，这正是以新高买入股票这一策略如此有效的原因。对于大多数人来说，这一点并不明显，因为他们害怕买入价格看似过高的股票，正如奥尼尔所指出的，“对大多数人来说，价格过高且风险过大的股票最终通常会上涨，而价格过低且便宜的股票最终通常会下跌”（2009，174页）。市场常常试图欺骗大多数投资者，因此，如果某只股票价格创新高，导致市场对买入犹豫不决，那么这很可能正是买入该股票的最佳时机。Like O’Neil, Jesse Livermore appreciated higher-priced stocks far more than “cheap” stocks, advising, “One should never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced.... Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price relative to its value—even if the current level seems  low” (Jesse Livermore, How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 25).
与奥尼尔一样，杰西·利弗莫尔也更看重高价股票而非“低价”股票。他建议：“永远不要因为股票价格看起来高就卖出……反之，也永远不要因为股票价格从之前的高点大幅下跌就买入。下跌很可能是有充分理由的。即使目前的股价看起来很低，但相对于其价值而言，这只股票的售价可能仍然非常高。”（杰西·利弗莫尔，《股票交易之道》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第25页）。



AVERAGING DOWN 
摊低成本Trying to buy cheap stocks is but one frequent sin committed by novice or lazy investors. Another lazy man’s sin eschewed by O’Neil and his predecessors is the concept of “averaging down.” Richard Wyckoff observed, “A great deal of money is lost or tied up by people who make a practice of averaging. Their theory is that if they buy a security at 100 and it goes to 90, it is that much cheaper, and the lower it goes the cheaper it grows.”
试图低价买入股票只是新手或懒惰投资者常犯的错误之一。奥尼尔及其前辈们摒弃的另一种懒惰之举是“摊低成本”的概念。理查德·威科夫指出：“大量资金因那些习惯于摊低成本的人而损失或被套牢。他们的理论是，如果他们以100美元的价格买入一只股票，而它跌到90美元，那么它就便宜了100美元，而且价格越低，它的价值增长就越快。”Retail stock brokers, when in need of a way to avoid taking responsibility for a bad recommendation, often try to use “averaging down” as a way to justify the initial decision to purchase a stock at higher prices. To some extent, this evolved as a convenient corollary to the retail investment concept of “dollar-cost averaging” when purchasing mutual funds, about which we’re sure many readers are only too familiar. To O’Neil, this is shameful: “About the only thing that’s worse is for brokers to take themselves off the hook by advising customers to ‘average down.’ If I were advised to do this, I’d close my account and look for a smarter broker” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 247).
零售股票经纪人在需要逃避承担错误推荐责任时，常常试图用“摊低成本”来为他们最初以较高价格买入股票的决定辩护。在某种程度上，这可以看作是零售投资中“美元成本平均法”（即购买共同基金时采用的策略）的便捷延伸，我们相信许多读者对此都非常熟悉。奥尼尔认为这是可耻的：“唯一比这更糟糕的事情就是经纪人建议客户‘摊低成本’来逃避责任。如果有人建议我这样做，我会关闭我的账户，寻找一个更聪明的经纪人”（《股票赚钱之道》，第4版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔，2009]，247）。Jesse Livermore was no less harsh in his assessment of the averaging-down technique when he said, “It is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your mind” (How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 26). Richard Wyckoff took the concept just a little bit further by adding, “It is better to ‘average up’ than to ‘average down”’ (Stock Market Technique Number 1 [New York: Richard D. Wyckoff, 1933], 50). And as we know, O’Neil contrasts his sermons against averaging down by strongly advocating “averaging up” on one’s winning stocks.
杰西·利弗莫尔对摊低成本策略的评价同样严厉，他曾说：“如果第一笔交易亏损，进行第二笔交易是愚蠢的。永远不要摊低成本亏损。务必牢记这一点”（《股票交易指南》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第26页）。理查德·威科夫更进一步，补充道：“与其摊低成本，不如‘摊高成本’”（《股票市场技巧1》[纽约：理查德·D·威科夫，1933]，第50页）。众所周知，奥尼尔反对摊低成本，并强烈提倡对盈利股票进行“摊高成本”。



CUTTING LOSSES QUICKLY 
快速止损Jesse Livermore wrote in How to Trade in Stocks, “You should have a clear target where to sell if the market moves against you. And you must obey your rules! Never sustain a loss of more than 10 percent of your capital. Losses are twice as expensive to make up. I always established a stop before making a trade” (How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 171). O’Neil advises a 7 to 8 percent automatic stop-loss policy on all stock purchases, and the main reason for this is to keep oneself out of  danger. Huge losses in the market can be debilitating, and O’Neil views a strict stop-loss policy, whether at his threshold of 6 to 7 percent or Livermore’s 10 percent, as absolutely necessary for survival in the stock market. Livermore observed, “Taking the first small loss is wise . . .profits take care of themselves but losses never do” (1991, 7).
杰西·利弗莫尔在《股票交易之道》一书中写道：“你应该有一个明确的目标，在市场走势不利于你时卖出。而且你必须遵守你的规则！永远不要让损失超过你本金的10%。弥补损失的成本是其两倍。我总是在交易前设置止损点。”（《股票交易之道》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，171页）。奥尼尔建议在所有股票购买中采用7%到8%的自动止损策略，其主要原因是避免风险。市场中的巨额损失可能令人难以承受，奥尼尔认为，严格的止损策略，无论是他设定的6%到7%的阈值，还是利弗莫尔的10%，对于在股市中生存都至关重要。利弗莫尔观察到，“接受第一次小亏损是明智的……利润会自行解决，但亏损永远不会”（1991，7）。Richard Wyckoff in Stock Market Technique Number 1 advised: “Your first line of defense is a stop order—placed when you make the trade, or immediately thereafter. If you fail to limit your risk at inception, make a practice of looking over your commitments every day, or twice every week and selling out, at the market, all showing a loss. That will keep your sheet clean and allow your profitable trades to run until the time comes to close them out” (1933, 96). This concept of using a stop-loss as a “line of defense” runs parallel to O’Neil’s thinking that “letting your losses run is the most serious mistake made by almost all investors” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 2nd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995], 93) simply because “[i]f you don’t sell to cut your losses when you get into trouble, you can easily lose the confidence you’ll need to make buy and sell decisions in the future” (1995, 252). Not only do losses cut into the capital an investor has available to capitalize on potential opportunities in the stock market, they also take their toll on an investor’s psychological capital, their all-important self-confidence.
理查德·威科夫在《股票市场技巧1》中建议：“你的第一道防线是止损单——在交易时或交易后立即设置。如果你在交易之初未能限制风险，那就养成每天或每周两次检查你的持仓，并在市场出现亏损时全部卖出的习惯。这样可以保持你的账面清晰，并让盈利的交易持续进行，直到合适的时机平仓”（1933，96）。这种将止损作为“防线”的理念与奥尼尔的观点不谋而合，他认为“让亏损持续下去是几乎所有投资者都会犯的最严重的错误”（《股票投资致富之道》，第二版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，1995]，93），原因很简单：“如果你在遇到麻烦时不及时止损，你很容易失去未来做出买卖决策所需的信心”（1995，252）。亏损不仅会减少投资者可用于把握股市潜在机会的资金，还会打击投资者的心理资本，也就是至关重要的自信心。To O’Neil, Livermore, and Wyckoff, losses are just part of the process, and it is always better to take a little pain now rather than a lot of pain later, because, as O’Neil reveals, “The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you’re wrong” (1995, 240).
在奥尼尔、利弗莫尔和威科夫看来，亏损只是投资过程的一部分，与其日后承受更大的痛苦，不如现在承受一些痛苦。正如奥尼尔所言：“股市大获成功的秘诀不在于永远正确，而在于犯错时尽可能减少损失”（1995，240）。



TAKING PROFITS TOO SOON—LETTING YOUR WINNERS RUN 
过早获利了结，让盈利股票继续增长The O’Neil methodology is essentially a trend-following system—you want to be in the market when the trend is in your favor, and you want to capture a large portion of any trend by riding with it for as long as possible. To O’Neil, buying a winning stock is only half the problem, because the key to capitalizing on a big price move in any potential, big, winning stock is in how you handle the stock once you have bought it. As Livermore said, it is the uncommon man who can “sit tight and be right,” so sitting with and properly handling a meaningful position in a big, winning stock through the bulk of its upside price move is a big part of how O’Neil makes big money in the stock market. This necessitates adhering to a basic principle that Livermore stipulated when he said, “As long as a stock is acting right, and  the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit” (How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 21). You can’t make big money in stocks if you don’t give them a chance to make big money for you.
奥尼尔的投资方法本质上是一种趋势跟踪系统——你要在市场趋势对你有利的时候入场，并且尽可能长时间地顺势而为，从而抓住趋势的大部分涨幅。对奥尼尔来说，买入一只热门股票仅仅是成功的一半，因为在任何潜在的热门股票的大幅价格波动中获利的关键在于买入之后如何管理这只股票。正如利弗莫尔所说，能够“坚持到底并最终获利”的人寥寥无几，因此，在热门股票价格上涨的大部分时间里，持有并妥善管理一个有意义的仓位，是奥尼尔在股市中赚取巨额财富的关键所在。这就要求我们遵循利弗莫尔提出的一个基本原则，他曾说过：“只要股票走势良好，市场行情也正常，就不要急于获利了结”（《股票交易指南》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第21页）。如果你不给股票创造财富的机会，你就无法在股票交易中赚到大钱。O’Neil recommends “take your losses quickly and your profits slowly,” because “your objective is not just to be right but to make big money when you are right” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 247-272). Trading for quick profits requires that one be constantly active and thinking about the next trade. It is a notoriously busy way to approach the market, and is entirely out of sync with the ideal that O’Neil-style investing tends toward. In our experience, there is nothing easier than making big money in the market once you have latched onto a big winner, because at that point all you are doing is sitting more and thinking less. When your stocks are trending nicely to the upside and you are fully invested, there is, from a practical standpoint, very little to do. You are simply letting your winners run. This is what we like to call “being in the zone,” a mental space that derives from Livermore’s principle: “It never is your thinking that makes big money. It’s the sitting” (Edwin Lefèvre,  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator [New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1994], 68).
奥尼尔建议“快速止损，缓慢获利”，因为“你的目标不仅是判断正确，更是在判断正确时赚取巨额利润”（《股票投资致富之道》，第四版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009]，247-272页）。追求快速获利的交易需要投资者时刻保持活跃，并不断思考下一笔交易。这种交易方式极其忙碌，与奥尼尔式投资理念完全背道而驰。根据我们的经验，一旦抓住一只大赢家，在市场中赚取巨额利润就变得轻而易举，因为此时你只需静观其变，无需过多思考。当你的股票走势良好且已满仓时，从实际角度来看，你几乎无需做什么。你只需让盈利的股票继续上涨即可。这就是我们所说的“进入状态”，一种源于利弗莫尔原则的精神状态：“真正让你赚大钱的从来不是你的思考，而是你的坐姿”（埃德温·勒费弗尔，《股票作手回忆录》[纽约：约翰·威利父子出版社，1994]，68页）。Richard Wyckoff had his own unique perspective on the idea of cutting losses quickly and letting winners run when he wrote in Stock Market Technique Number 1, “Are you getting rich backwards? Then you are taking two points profit on your speculative trades and letting your losses run. Why not reverse this rule? Limit your risk to one, two or three points and let your profits run” (1933, 52).
理查德·威科夫对快速止损、让盈利持续增长的理念有着自己独特的见解。他在《股票市场技巧1》中写道：“你是在反向致富吗？如果是这样，那么你在投机交易中只赚了两个点，却让亏损继续扩大。为什么不反过来呢？将风险限制在一、二或三个点，让利润继续增长”（1933年，52页）。



POSITION CONCENTRATION 
持仓集中度A big part of handling a winning stock correctly is properly scaling one’s position size. If you only want to make average market returns, then scale your positions to a very small size, and your portfolio will act very much like a market index. Having scores of positions is nothing more than “closet indexing.” Most mutual fund managers take positions that make up 1 to 2 percent of their portfolio equity or less, and they may have 100 to 200 positions or more. To O’Neil, this is anathema. If you want to make big returns, then you absolutely must concentrate your capital in a strongly-trending stock, and position sizes of 1 to 2 percent of one’s total portfolio equity are, to put it bluntly, quite wimpy from an O’Neil perspective. The O’Neil method of pyramiding into strongly acting positions while weeding out weaker ones generally gets an investor concentrated in the right stocks during a bull market cycle. At times, your authors have been fully invested  in as few as two stocks, using full, 200 percent margin, so that each position represents 100 percent of the account’s gross equity. This is how you make big money in the market, and it is the essence of handling one’s stocks properly to achieve maximum effect.
正确管理一只表现优异的股票，关键在于合理调整持仓规模。如果你只想获得市场平均收益，那么就应该将持仓规模控制在非常小的范围内，这样你的投资组合的表现就会非常接近市场指数。持有大量仓位无异于“伪装的指数投资”。大多数共同基金经理的持仓规模仅占其投资组合净值的1%到2%甚至更低，但他们持有的仓位可能多达100到200只甚至更多。在奥尼尔看来，这种做法是极其不可接受的。如果你想获得高额回报，就必须将资金集中投入到一只趋势强劲的股票中，而从奥尼尔的角度来看，仅占投资组合总净值的1%到2%的持仓规模，说得直白点，简直是小巫见大巫。奥尼尔的投资策略是，在牛市周期中，通过逐步增持表现强劲的股票，同时剔除表现疲软的股票，从而确保投资者能够集中投资于真正有价值的股票。有时，作者会将全部资金投入到两只股票中，并使用高达200%的保证金，使得每只股票都代表账户总权益的100%。这就是在股市中赚取巨额利润的方法，也是正确管理股票以实现最大收益的精髓所在。For this reason, O’Neil eschews “diversification” and cites the wisdom of Gerald Loeb, who declared that diversification was a “hedge for ignorance.” O’Neil’s solution was to be very specific about what stocks one owned in any bull market cycle, suggesting, “The more you diversify, the less you know about any one area. Many investors overdiversify. The best results are achieved through concentration: putting all your eggs in just a few baskets that you know a great deal about and continuing to watch those baskets very carefully” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 274).
因此，奥尼尔摒弃了“分散投资”的概念，并引用了杰拉尔德·勒布的名言，勒布认为分散投资是“对冲无知的手段”。奥尼尔的解决方案是在任何牛市周期中，都要非常明确地选择自己持有的股票，他指出：“你分散投资越多，对任何一个领域的了解就越少。许多投资者过度分散投资。最佳结果来自于集中投资：把所有的鸡蛋放在你非常了解的几个篮子里，并持续密切关注这些篮子”（《股票投资致富之道》，第4版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009年]，第274页）。The purpose of position concentration from an O’Neil perspective is two-fold. On the one hand it allows an investor to fully capitalize on a big price move in a winning stock, while on the other it allows the investor to focus his or her attention on “fewer eggs,” which O’Neil views as a safer mental approach than trying to keep track of too many positions at once. Even Livermore himself thought “. . . that it is dangerous to start spreading out all over the market. By this I mean, do not have an interest in too many stocks at one time. It is much easier to watch a few than many” (How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 33).
从奥尼尔的角度来看，集中持仓的目的有二。一方面，它能让投资者充分利用热门股票的大幅价格波动；另一方面，它能让投资者将注意力集中在“少数几只股票”上，奥尼尔认为这比同时关注太多仓位要稳妥得多。就连利弗莫尔本人也认为，“……分散投资于整个市场是危险的。我的意思是，不要同时关注太多股票。关注几只股票远比关注很多只股票容易得多”（《股票交易之道》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第33页）。To O’Neil, it is not necessary to own every stock in the market; to have a need to “kiss all the babies,” as he is fond of saying. He whittles it all down to one basic concept: “The winning investor’s objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 274).
对奥尼尔来说，没有必要持有市场上的每一只股票；没有必要像他常说的那样，“亲吻所有的小婴儿”。他将所有要点归结为一个基本概念：“成功的投资者应该追求一两只大赢家，而不是几十只小赢家”（《股票投资致富之道》，第4版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009年]，第274页）。



DEALING IN BIG STOCKS AND INSTITUTIONAL SPONSORSHIP 
交易大型股票及机构支持Owning the biggest winners in the market means owning the stocks that institutions are piling into, and O’Neil sees modern-day mutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds, and other members of the “institutional investor zoo,” as akin to the “pools” and “trusts” of Jesse Livermore’s and Richard Wyckoff’s era. It is the accumulation of stock by large institutions that produces the huge price moves upon which O’Neil methodologies seek to capitalize. And the smart institutions, such as those with the better research and stock selection skills, are the ones in whose footsteps you want to follow. O’Neil asserts, “It takes big demand to push up prices, and by far the biggest source of demand for stocks is institutional investors, such as  mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, [etc]. A winning stock doesn’t need a huge number of institutional owners, but it should have several at a minimum.” O’Neil continues, “[Diligent investors] look for stocks that are held by at least one or two of the more savvy portfolio managers who have the best performance records” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 193-194).
持有市场中最大的赢家意味着持有机构投资者蜂拥而至的股票。奥尼尔认为，如今的共同基金、对冲基金、养老基金以及其他“机构投资者群体”类似于杰西·利弗莫尔和理查德·威科夫时代的“资金池”和“信托”。正是大型机构的股票积累造就了巨大的价格波动，而奥尼尔的投资方法正是试图从中获利。那些拥有更出色研究和选股能力的精明机构，才是你应该效仿的对象。奥尼尔断言：“巨大的需求才能推高股价，而股票需求的最大来源无疑是机构投资者，例如共同基金、养老基金、对冲基金、保险公司等等。一只成功的股票并不需要大量的机构投资者，但至少应该有几个。”奥尼尔继续说道：“（勤奋的投资者）会寻找至少一两位业绩最好的、更精明的投资组合经理持有的股票”（《股票投资致富之道》，第 4 版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔，2009 年]，193-194 页）。Knowing where the smart money is moving is central to O’Neil’s methodology, and understanding the quality of institutional sponsorship coming into a stock is no different from what Richard Wyckoff advised when he wrote, “It is important to know whether large operators, inside interests, pools, or the public dominate the market for a certain security or group.” Wyckoff went on to explain, “The reason this is so important is as follows: A combination of bankers will seldom be found on the long side of the market unless they expect a pronounced change in security market conditions in the near future. Their own purchases, therefore, are an indication of probable betterment. When a pool takes hold, it is usually in a certain one or a few issues which are likely to be favorably affected by developments known to a few but not generally known” (How I Trade and Invest in Stocks & Bonds [New York: The Magazine of Wall Street, 1924], 183).
了解聪明资金的流向是奥尼尔投资方法的核心，而了解机构投资者对某只股票的投资质量，与理查德·威科夫的建议并无二致。威科夫曾写道：“重要的是要知道，对于某只证券或某类股票而言，主导市场的是大型机构、内部利益集团、资金池还是公众。” 威科夫进一步解释道：“这一点如此重要的原因如下：除非银行家们预期证券市场状况在不久的将来会发生显著变化，否则他们很少会做多。因此，他们的买入行为预示着市场可能出现好转。当资金池占据主导地位时，通常会集中投资于某些特定的或少数几只股票，这些股票可能会受到一些只有少数人知道但公众并不了解的因素的有利影响。”（《我如何交易和投资股票和债券》[纽约：华尔街杂志，1924]，183页）。O’Neil’s unique and deep understanding of the institutional investor and the implications of institutional sponsorship is founded in the experience he has had advising some of the largest and most successful institutional investors on the planet. It is this understanding that generates what we have dubbed The Big Stock Principle that drove O’Neil’s thinking in any market cycle. Knowing which stocks represented the cutting edge of developments driving any particular economic, and hence market, cycle means knowing where institutional investors “have to be” with respect to positioning their portfolios. When institutional investors start shoveling money into stocks that they “have to be” invested in, this fuels tremendous upside price moves in those stocks, and it is what makes them “Big Stocks.” It is a central tenet of O’Neil-style investing.
奥尼尔对机构投资者及其投资影响的独特而深刻的理解，源于他为全球一些规模最大、最成功的机构投资者提供咨询服务的经验。正是这种理解，催生了我们称之为“大股原则”的理念，并贯穿于奥尼尔在任何市场周期中的投资思路。了解哪些股票代表着推动特定经济周期（进而影响市场周期）发展的前沿趋势，意味着了解机构投资者在投资组合配置方面“必须”关注哪些股票。当机构投资者开始将资金投入到他们“必须”投资的股票时，这将推动这些股票价格出现巨大的上涨，而这正是它们成为“大股”的原因。这是奥尼尔式投资的核心原则。



CHART PATTERNS 
图表形态Books like How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market, by the famous ballroom dancer Nicolas Darvas, figure into O’Neil’s concepts of “bases,” which Darvas termed “boxes.” O’Neil, however, took it quite a bit further with his colorful, descriptive cataloguing of consolidation patterns or bases that he termed “ascending,” “cup-with-handle,” “double-bottom,” “square box,” “flat base,” and “high, tight flag,” among others—the chart  patterns from which, as O’Neil observed, big, winning stocks emerged as they started their huge upside price romps. As well, these patterns represented the “continuation” that patterns hugely performing stocks form on the way up as they naturally and normally pause and digest their gains during an overall intermediate to longer-term price run before proceeding higher.
著名舞厅舞者尼古拉斯·达瓦斯 (Nicolas Darvas) 的著作《我如何在股市赚到 200 万美元》(How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market) 等书籍，对奥尼尔的“底部”概念有所启发。达瓦斯将这些底部称为“箱体”。然而，奥尼尔更进一步，用生动形象的描述对盘整形态或底部形态进行了分类，他称之为“上升形态”、“杯柄形态”、“双底形态”、“方箱形态”、“平底形态”和“高而紧的旗形形态”等等。奥尼尔观察到，许多表现优异的股票正是从这些图表形态中脱颖而出，开始它们价格的大幅上涨。此外，这些形态也代表了表现优异的股票在上涨过程中形成的“延续”模式。在中长期价格上涨行情中，这些股票通常会在上涨过程中暂停并消化涨幅，然后再继续走高。Like O’Neil and his bases, Darvas’s “box theory” emerged from his own direct observation and study of stock charts and tables: “I started to realize that stock movements were not completely haphazard. Stocks did not fly like balloons in any direction. As if attracted by a magnet, they had a defined upward or downward trend which, once established, tended to continue. Within this trend stocks moved in a series of frames, or what I began to call boxes. They would oscillate fairly consistently between a low and a high point. The area which enclosed this up-and-down movement represented the box or frame. These boxes began to exist very clearly for me” (Nicolas Darvas, How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market [New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1998], 51).
与奥尼尔及其基本盘一样，达瓦斯的“箱体理论”也源于他对股票图表和表格的直接观察和研究：“我开始意识到股票的走势并非完全随机。股票不会像气球一样朝任何方向飘荡。它们仿佛被磁铁吸引一般，呈现出明确的上升或下降趋势，一旦形成，这种趋势往往会持续下去。在这种趋势中，股票的走势遵循一系列框架，或者我称之为‘箱体’。它们会在低点和高点之间相当稳定地波动。包围这种上下波动的区域就代表了箱体或框架。这些箱体在我眼中变得非常清晰”（尼古拉斯·达瓦斯，《我如何在股市赚到200万美元》[纽约：卡罗尔出版集团，1998]，51）。O’Neil is far more specific, however, about the precise structure of these “boxes” or “bases,” and his work goes into much detail about the exact shapes, durations, and magnitudes of these various price consolidation structures. But, like Darvas, O’Neil recognizes: “Chart patterns are simply areas of price correction and consolidation, usually after an earlier price advance. The primary challenge in analyzing price consolidation structures is to diagnose if the price and volume movements are normal or, instead, signal significant weakness or distribution” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 2nd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995], 161).
然而，奥尼尔对这些“箱体”或“底部”的具体结构描述得更为具体，他的研究详细阐述了各种价格盘整结构的具体形状、持续时间和幅度。但与达瓦斯一样，奥尼尔也认识到：“图表形态仅仅是价格回调和盘整的区域，通常是在之前的价格上涨之后。分析价格盘整结构的主要挑战在于判断价格和成交量的波动是正常的，还是预示着明显的疲软或派发”（《股票投资致富之道》，第二版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，1995]，161页）。It is, however, important to understand that Darvas’s “box theory” is nothing more than a very rudimentary, initial version of O’Neil’s chart pattern zoo. Darvas never bothered to measure the minimum durations for his boxes to determine whether a longer duration was preferable to a shorter one, nor did he measure the magnitude, or range, of these boxes to determine any meaningful characteristics thereby. As he puts it, “I found that a stock sometimes stayed for weeks in one box. I did not care how long it stayed in its box as long as it did—and did not fall below the lower frame figure” (How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market [New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1998], 52).
然而，重要的是要理解，达瓦斯的“箱体理论”只不过是奥尼尔图表形态体系的一个非常原始的早期版本。达瓦斯从未费心去测量他所研究的箱体的最小持续时间，以确定较长的持续时间是否优于较短的持续时间，也没有测量这些箱体的幅度或范围，从而确定任何有意义的特征。正如他所说，“我发现一只股票有时会在一个盒子里待上好几个星期。我不在乎它在盒子里待了多久，只要它待在那里——而且没有跌破下限数字就行了”（《我如何在股市赚到 200 万美元》[纽约：卡罗尔出版集团，1998 年]，第 52 页）。O’Neil also went way beyond the simplistic “box theory” by recognizing the importance of applying historical precedent in his work. O’Neil observed that the chart patterns formed by market-leading stocks in one market cycle often repeated themselves in the market leaders of a later cycle. As an example, O’Neil has discussed in public forums how a big pullback by America Online (AOL) to its 50-day moving average back in 1998  reminded him of another big winner he played, Syntex Corp., in 1965. In this manner, Syntex served as a “historical precedent” for AOL in 1998, and served as an invaluable guide in helping O’Neil handle the position for what turned out to be massive gains. We know—we were there when it happened.
奥尼尔不仅超越了简单的“箱线图理论”，还认识到运用历史先例的重要性。他观察到，在一个市场周期中领涨股所形成的图表形态，往往会在下一个周期的领涨股中重现。例如，奥尼尔曾在公开场合谈到，1998年美国在线（AOL）股价大幅回调至50日均线附近，这让他想起了1965年他曾成功投资的另一只股票——Syntex公司。从这个意义上讲，Syntex公司成为了1998年AOL的“历史先例”，并为奥尼尔提供了宝贵的指导，最终帮助他成功持有该股票，并获得了巨额收益。我们对此深有体会——因为我们当时就在现场。The idea of historical precedence, of course, can be seen as derived from Jesse Livermore, who declared in How to Trade in Stocks, “I absolutely believe that price movement patterns are being repeated. They are recurring patterns that appear over and over, with slight variations. This is because markets are driven by humans—and human nature never changes” (Greenville: Traders Press, 1991, 96). And, as O’Neil says, “It’s just history repeating itself over and over again, human nature continually on parade” (The Successful Investor, 3rd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004], 84). Wyckoff also observed that, “In a certain sense, reading charts is like reading music, in which both endeavor to interpret correctly the composer’s ideas and the expression of his art. Just so a chart of the averages, or of a single stock, reflects the ideas, hopes, ambitions, and purposes of the mass mind operating in the market, or of a manipulator handling a single stock” (Stock Market Technique Number 2 [New York: Richard D. Wyckoff, 1933], 136).
当然，历史先例的概念可以追溯到杰西·利弗莫尔，他在《股票交易之道》中宣称：“我坚信价格走势模式正在重复出现。这些模式反复出现，只是略有不同。这是因为市场是由人驱动的——而人性永不改变”（格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991年，第96页）。正如奥尼尔所说，“这只是历史的不断重演，人性在不断上演”（《成功的投资者》，第三版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2004年]，第84页）。威科夫还观察到，“从某种意义上说，读图表就像读乐谱，两者都力求正确解读作曲家的思想和艺术表达。同样，平均指数图表或单只股票的图表反映了在市场中运作的大众思想，或操纵单只股票的操纵者的思想、希望、抱负和目的”（《股票市场技巧2》[纽约：理查德·D·威科夫，1933年]，136页）。O’Neil is often pejoratively dismissed as a “chartist,” as if this is proof that he should be written off as some sort of investment pariah. But we should not forget that while he was a pioneer in figuring out how to automate the production of printed stock charts, he was not the first to recognize the usefulness of charts in stock forecasting. In Stock Market Technique 2, Richard Wyckoff devoted a short chapter to answering Why You Should Choose Charts and summed up his assessment of the usefulness of consulting stock price charts by writing, “The ticker records stock market history on a long strip of tape. The charts record the same history transposed into another form, more convenient, more valuable for the purpose of studying past performance as an aid in forecasting—I should say invaluable ” (1933, 66).
奥尼尔经常被贬称为“图表分析师”，仿佛这证明他应该被视为投资界的弃儿。但我们不应忘记，虽然他是发明股票图表自动化制作方法的先驱，但他并非第一个认识到图表在股票预测中作用的人。在《股票市场技术2》中，理查德·威科夫用一小章的篇幅解答了“为何选择图表”的问题，并总结了他对参考股价图表的评价：“股票行情机将股票市场历史记录在一长条纸带上。图表则将同样的历史转换成另一种形式，这种形式更方便，更有价值，便于研究过去的表现，从而辅助预测——我甚至要说，它价值连城”（1933，66）。For O’Neil, technical analysis and the use of charts is all about determining the actions of institutional investors as they set about systematically accumulating stocks. In this way O’Neil does not approach the use of charts in a mechanical way, without incorporating any aspects of judgment, but rather as a tool to determine what the big players, the institutions, are doing. In this manner he is similar to Wyckoff, who advised that investors study charts in order to uncover the “motives behind the market action to interpret the behavior of stocks” (Charting the Stock Market, The Wyckoff Method, ed. Jack K. Huston [Seattle: Technical Analysis, Inc., 1948], 13, 16).
对奥尼尔而言，技术分析和图表的使用，其根本目的在于分析机构投资者在系统性地积累股票时的行为。奥尼尔并非机械地运用图表，而是将其视为一种工具，用来判断大型机构投资者的动向。这一点上，他与威科夫颇为相似。威科夫建议投资者研究图表，以揭示“市场行为背后的动机，从而解读股票走势”（《股票市场图表：威科夫方法》，杰克·K·休斯顿编 [西雅图：技术分析公司，1948]，第13、16页）。



PIVOTAL POINTS VERSUS PIVOT POINTS 
关键点与转折点Buying at the exact right point is a key mechanic in the O’Neil methodology, and O’Neil’s concept of a “pivot point” is drawn from Livermore’s “pivotal point,” of which Livermore had a “reversal pivotal point” and a “continuation pivotal point.” We might consider O’Neil’s pivot point buy points in stocks, generally defined by breakouts to new price highs, as more in keeping with Livermore’s concept of a “continuation pivot point,” whereas O’Neil’s concept of a “follow-through day” as confirming an upturn in the market after a prior correction or bear market to be similar to Livermore’s “reversal pivotal point” since it indicates a reversal in the market’s trend from bear to bull phase. In How to Trade in Stocks by Jesse Livermore and How to Make Money in Stocks by William O’Neil, both writers share a common regard for such a “pivot” or “pivotal” buy point as the exact point where the risk/reward equation is most in the investor’s favor, where the ducks are lined up in a row, so to speak, and so the stock should be bought once the price reaches this key pivot/pivotal point.
在奥尼尔投资策略中，精准的买入时机至关重要。奥尼尔的“枢轴点”概念源于利弗莫尔的“枢轴点”理论，后者又分为“反转枢轴点”和“延续枢轴点”。我们可以认为，奥尼尔的股票枢轴点买入点（通常定义为突破新高）更符合利弗莫尔的“延续枢轴点”概念；而奥尼尔的“后续上涨日”概念（确认市场在先前的回调或熊市后出现反弹）则更类似于利弗莫尔的“反转枢轴点”，因为它标志着市场趋势从熊市转为牛市。在杰西·利弗莫尔的《如何进行股票交易》和威廉·奥尼尔的《如何通过股票赚钱》中，两位作者都对“枢轴点”或“关键”买入点抱有共同的看法，认为这是风险/回报等式最有利于投资者的确切点，可以说，一切都恰到好处，因此一旦价格达到这个关键的枢轴点，就应该买入股票。Waiting for the pivotal point to present itself requires patience, and Livermore would do his best to avoid taking action until and unless the correct pivotal point signal was given, because this assured his success, as he puts it, “Whenever I had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a ‘Pivotal Point’ before I started to trade, I have always made money in my operations. Why? Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the beginning of a move” (How to Trade in Stocks  [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 43). O’Neil says, “The winning individual investor can afford to wait and begin buying at these precise pivot points. This is where the real move starts and all the exciting action originates” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 2nd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995], 164). The correct buy point lies at what both O’Neil and Livermore saw as a “line of least resistance,” where the stock was “in the clear” and able to launch higher with little to no impediment.
等待关键点出现需要耐心，利弗莫尔总是尽力避免采取行动，直到出现正确的关键点信号为止，因为这能确保他的成功。正如他所说：“每当我有耐心等待市场到达我所谓的‘关键点’后再开始交易时，我的交易总是能盈利。为什么？因为我那时正好在行情开始的心理时机入场”（《股票交易指南》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第43页）。奥尼尔说：“成功的个人投资者可以承受等待并在这些精确的关键点开始买入。真正的行情从这里开始，所有激动人心的交易也由此展开”（《股票赚钱指南》，第二版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，1995]，第164页）。正确的买入点是奥尼尔和利弗莫尔都认为的“阻力最小线”，即股票“畅通无阻”且能够几乎没有任何阻碍地向上突破的点。The point of buying right is to enter a stock right at the point where the real move begins, so that if a stock is trading at 50, but the correct pivotal point is at 55, one must still wait for the stock to trade at the higher price if it is determined that this is where the line of least resistance lies. In this way, neither O’Neil nor Livermore were interested in capturing the movement between 50 and 55 as the stock approached the 55 pivotal point, but rather the “big move” from 55 to 100. As O’Neil says in How to Make Money in Stocks, second edition, “Your object is never to buy at the cheapest price or near the low but to begin buying at exactly the right time. This means you have to learn to wait for a stock to move up and trade at your buy point  before making an initial commitment” (p. 165). In Chapter 6, we take the concept of pivot and pivotal points further.
买入的要点在于，在股票真正开始上涨的点位买入。例如，如果一只股票的交易价格为 50，但正确的关键点位在 55，那么如果确定 55 是阻力最小的点位，就必须等待股票价格上涨到更高的价格。因此，奥尼尔和利弗莫尔都对股票价格接近 55 关键点位时 50 到 55 之间的波动不感兴趣，而是关注从 55 到 100 的“大涨”。正如奥尼尔在《如何在股市赚钱》（第二版）中所说：“你的目标永远不是以最低价或接近最低价买入，而是在恰当的时机开始买入。这意味着你必须学会等待股票价格上涨并达到你的买入点位后再进行初始投资”（第 165 页）。在第六章中，我们将进一步探讨关键点位和枢轴点的概念。



TIMING THE MARKET: WHEN TO BE IN, WHEN TO BE OUT 
把握市场时机：何时入场，何时离场From the O’Neil/Livermore perspective, waiting for the “pivotal point,” or the exact right time to enter the markets means only being in the market when it is ripe for making money. Wait for the trend to develop and then jump on. A line with which we are all familiar came from something Jesse Livermore wrote in How to Trade in Stocks, “Successful traders always follow the line of least resistance. Follow the trend. The trend is your friend” (Greenville: Traders Press, 1991, 69).
从奥尼尔/利弗莫尔的视角来看，等待“关键点”，也就是入场的最佳时机，意味着只在市场真正适合赚钱的时候才入场。等待趋势形成，然后果断入场。杰西·利弗莫尔在《如何交易股票》一书中写道：“成功的交易者总是选择阻力最小的路径。顺势而为。趋势是你的朋友。”（格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991年，第69页）O’Neil and Livermore both maintain that there is a time to be in the market and a time to be out of the market, even though common investment wisdom dictates that one cannot time the market and therefore should always be fully invested in the market so as not to miss a bull phase and fail to keep up with the market indexes. O’Neil vigorously disagrees with such mindless orthodoxy when he writes, “Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t time the market. This is a giant myth passed on mainly by Wall Street, the media, and those who have never been able to do it, so they think it’s impossible.” According to O’Neil, “The erroneous belief that you can’t time the market—that it’s simply impossible, that no one can do it—evolved more than 40 years ago after a few mutual fund managers tried it unsuccessfully. They relied on personal judgments and feelings to determine when the market finally hit bottom and turned up for real. At the bottom, the news is all negative. So these managers, being human, hesitated to act” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 200).
奥尼尔和利弗莫尔都认为，入市和离市都有其时机，尽管传统的投资智慧认为，人们无法预测市场时机，因此应该始终满仓，以免错过牛市，也无法跟上市场指数的步伐。奥尼尔强烈反对这种盲目的正统观念，他写道：“永远不要让任何人告诉你你无法预测市场时机。这完全是华尔街、媒体以及那些从未成功预测过市场时机的人散布的巨大谣言，所以他们认为这是不可能的。”奥尼尔指出：“认为无法择时入市——认为这根本不可能，没有人能做到——这种错误观念是在40多年前一些共同基金经理尝试择时失败后形成的。他们依靠个人判断和感觉来判断市场何时触底反弹。在市场触底时，所有消息都是负面的。因此，这些经理人毕竟是人，所以犹豫不决，不敢采取行动”（《股票投资致富之道》，第4版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009年]，第200页）。Indeed, opinions have no place when it comes to stock selection or market timing, and we have sought to implement objectivity to our methods. The “Dr. K Market Direction Model,” which is discussed in detail in Chapter 7, is a statistical formalization of the price/volume action of the NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 Indexes. The timing model, from its earlier forms to its most evolved form of today, has guided our trading with success since 1991. It was inspired by the “M” in O’Neil’s “CAN SLIM” investment system. More about Dr. K’s Market Direction Model and the current market timing signal can be found at the following web site:  www.virtueofselfishinvesting.com, and Gil Morales’s work with respect to market trend timing can be found at www.gilmoreport.com.

EMOTIONS AND PREDICTIONS 
情绪与预测Trading the market is a very “Zen” activity, where you stay in the now, not worrying about what the market will do in the future, and not getting upset about a bad trade you may have made in the past. Instead one should stay focused in the present, reacting in real time to the evidence that the market is constantly presenting. No one has ever been able to predict market direction with any consistent reliability, but that is wholly unnecessary to being a successful investor. Successful investing is about watching the market day-to-day and acting accordingly. In fact, attempting to predict the market often leads to over-intellectualization, which is usually a recipe for losing money in the market. When the market goes against your own intellectualized “conclusions,” you may be less likely to reverse your position, even in the face of factual price/volume action that is telling you that you are wrong. Pay less attention to what you think the market should be doing, and more to what the market is actually doing. As Livermore wrote, “Don’t try and anticipate what the market will do next—simply go with the evidence of what the market is telling you—presenting you.” (Richard Smitten, Trade Like Jesse Livermore [Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2005], 13).
交易市场是一种非常“禅意”的活动，它要求你专注于当下，不去担忧市场未来的走向，也不去纠结于过去可能出现的糟糕交易。相反，你应该专注于当下，对市场不断呈现的信息做出实时反应。没有人能够始终如一地准确预测市场走向，但这对于成为一名成功的投资者来说完全没有必要。成功的投资在于每日观察市场并据此采取行动。事实上，试图预测市场往往会导致过度理性化，而这通常是亏损的根源。当市场走势与你理性化的“结论”相悖时，即使实际的价格/成交量走势表明你错了，你也不太可能改变立场。与其关注你认为市场应该如何走，不如更多地关注市场实际的走势。正如利弗莫尔所写，“不要试图预测市场下一步会做什么——只需遵循市场正在告诉你、呈现给你的证据。”（理查德·斯米滕，《像杰西·利弗莫尔一样交易》[霍博肯，新泽西州：约翰·威利父子出版社，2005 年]，第 13 页）。In the same vein as Livermore, O’Neil preaches that an investor does not need to know what the market is going to do, but only what it is doing right now. O’Neil wrote in How to Make Money in Stocks, third edition, “The key to staying on top of the stock market is not predicting or knowing what the market is going to do. It’s knowing and understanding what the market has actually done in the past several weeks and what it is currently doing now” (2002, 75). Even Wyckoff adhered to this concept of remaining in the present at all times as he evaluated fresh evidence from the market in real time. He declared, “I am not one of the many who form opinions as to the future course of the stock market and then insist that the market justify their predictions.... It is enough to know that the market tells me what it is probably going to do today and in the near future. I do not expect to be informed very far in advance, because the market often changes its course. I must change my position accordingly” (Stock Market Technique Number 1 [New York: Richard D. Wyckoff, 1933], 53).
与利弗莫尔的观点类似，奥尼尔也认为投资者无需预知市场走向，只需关注其当下的走势。奥尼尔在其著作《如何在股市赚钱》（第三版）中写道：“驾驭股市的关键不在于预测或预知市场走向，而在于了解并理解市场在过去几周的实际表现以及当前的走势”（2002，75）。就连威科夫也秉持着这种始终关注当下的理念，实时评估来自市场的最新信息。他宣称：“我不是那些对股市未来走势形成意见，然后坚持要求市场证明其预测正确的人之一……我只需要知道市场告诉我它今天和不久的将来可能会做什么就足够了。我不指望能提前很久就知道，因为市场经常改变走向。我必须相应地调整我的仓位”（《股市技巧1》[纽约：理查德·D·威科夫，1933年]，第53页）。This entire line of thought speaks to the concept of keeping one’s emotions out of the equation. To Livermore, the twin evils of fear and hope were the undoing of most investors who operated heavily in the realm of emotion. Perhaps it is not so much that investors fear and then hope, but that they rarely fear or hope at the right time, as Livermore observed, “. . . when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation . . .you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse positions” (How to Trade  in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 20). On the other hand, when it comes to operating without fear, and keeping one’s emotions in check when taking losses in the market, O’Neil borrows a bit of advice that comes from Richard Wyckoff suggesting one “sell down to the sleeping point.”
整套思路都围绕着一个核心理念：将个人情绪排除在外。利弗莫尔认为，恐惧和希望这两大“恶魔”是大多数情绪化投资者的致命弱点。或许问题不在于投资者先恐惧后希望，而在于他们很少在恰当的时机感到恐惧或希望。正如利弗莫尔所观察到的，“……当你把希望和恐惧注入投机活动中……你很容易将二者混淆，甚至使它们处于相反的位置”（《股票交易指南》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第20页）。另一方面，谈到如何在无所畏惧的情况下进行交易，以及在市场亏损时控制情绪，奥尼尔借鉴了理查德·威科夫的建议，即“卖到止损点”。



LISTENING TO OPINIONS, NEWS, AND TIPS 
倾听观点、新闻和建议When someone asks for a tip, it is best to tell them this: “Take no tips.” Much money is lost by those who listen to tips. The person giving the tip may have an underlying motive. Or he just may not have all the facts even though he thinks he does. As Jesse Livermore wrote in How to Trade in Stocks, “Markets are never wrong—opinions often are” (1991, 18).
当有人向你索要内幕消息时，最好这样告诉他们：“不要听信任何内幕消息。” 听信内幕消息的人往往会损失惨重。提供内幕消息的人可能另有所图，或者他可能只是掌握了部分事实，尽管他自认为掌握了。正如杰西·利弗莫尔在《如何交易股票》一书中写道：“市场永远不会出错——意见却常常出错”（1991，18）。Markets are the final arbiter of all news known up to that point in time. At least that is what the big auction known as the stock market does. It prices the stock relative to its peers, so it is best to believe the market’s assessment.
市场是当时所有已知信息的最终仲裁者。至少，这就是被称为股票市场的这个大型拍卖会的运作方式。它会根据股票的同类股票来定价，因此最好相信市场的评估。O’Neil wrote in How to Make Money in Stocks, fourth edition, “Many people are too willing to risk their hard-earned money on the basis of what someone else says, rather than taking the time to study, learn, and know for sure what they’re doing. As a result, they risk losing a lot of money. Most rumors and tips you hear simply aren’t true” (2009, 305). The same could be said of opinions by experts. O’Neil continued, “Maybe this explains why virtually every analyst appearing on CNBC after September 2000 continually recommended buying high-tech stocks as they were on their way to 80-90 percent declines.” To paraphrase Livermore, opinions are often wrong, but markets never are.
奥尼尔在《股票投资致富之道》（第四版）中写道：“许多人太容易轻信他人之言，将自己辛辛苦苦赚来的钱投入股市，而不是花时间去研究、学习，确保自己对所做的事情了如指掌。结果，他们很可能损失惨重。你听到的大多数传言和建议根本就不是真的”（2009，305）。专家的意见也同样如此。奥尼尔继续说道：“或许这可以解释为什么2000年9月之后，几乎所有出现在CNBC上的分析师都不断建议买入高科技股票，而当时这些股票正朝着80%到90%的跌幅发展。”套用利弗莫尔的话来说，意见常常是错的，但市场永远不会错。Yet much of the investing public prefers the lazy way out. Wyckoff wrote, “Depending on the advice of others is a widespread public weakness” (quoted in William O’Neil How to Make Money in Stocks, 3rd ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2002], 253). Many prefer to be handed the answers. Over the years, the question we have heard most frequently is “What are you buying?” The person asking the question usually has little understanding of the market and even less confidence in her own judgment, since she has not done the necessary preparation. Diligent study is the antidote. Wyckoff wrote, “When you understand stock market science you have no concern about important developments in your morning newspaper, because the news is not a factor in your operations. An experienced judge of the market regards the whole story that appears on the tape as though it were the expression of a single mind; that is, the composite mind of all traders, investors, bankers, pools, institutions, and others who are  participating in the transactions” (Stock Market Technique Number 2 [New York: Richard D. Wyckoff], 139).
然而，许多投资者却更倾向于选择最省事的方式。威科夫写道：“依赖他人建议是公众普遍存在的弱点”（引自威廉·奥尼尔《股票致富之道》，第三版[纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2002年]，第253页）。许多人更喜欢别人直接给出答案。多年来，我们最常听到的问题是“你在买什么？”提问者通常对市场知之甚少，对自己的判断更是缺乏信心，因为她没有做好必要的准备。勤奋学习是解决之道。威科夫写道：“当你了解股市科学时，你就不会在意晨报上的重要新闻，因为新闻不会影响你的交易。一位经验丰富的市场判断者会将盘带上呈现的整个故事视为一个整体思想的表达；也就是说，它是所有交易员、投资者、银行家、资金池、机构和其他参与交易的人的共同思想”（《股市技巧2》[纽约：理查德·D·威科夫]，139）。



OVERTRADING 
过度交易Once an investor becomes seasoned and has developed a winning strategy that he has executed successfully for a number of years, he is still not immune to overtrading. Overtrading seems to plague both novice and expert alike, both in terms of trading when one should just be sitting in cash, and in terms of selling a position too soon, only to buy it back a few days later, then repeating this pattern of buying and selling.
即使投资者经验丰富，并制定了行之有效的策略，且成功执行多年，也无法避免过度交易。过度交易似乎困扰着新手和专家，既包括在应该持有现金时进行交易，也包括在过早卖出持仓后几天又买回，如此反复。Jesse Livermore wrote of an investor who lived in the mountains and received quotes that were three days old. Only a few times a year would this investor call his broker to place trades. This man was quite detached from the markets, so it came as a total surprise when people learned of his remarkable long-term success in the markets. When asked about his success, the man replied, “Well, I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need” (How to Trade in Stocks [Greenville: Traders Press, 1991], 32).
杰西·利弗莫尔曾写过一位住在山区的投资者，他收到的报价都是三天前的。这位投资者一年只给经纪人打几次电话进行交易。他与市场几乎完全隔绝，因此当人们得知他在市场中取得的长期成功时，都感到非常惊讶。当被问及成功的秘诀时，他回答说：“嗯，我把投机当成一门生意。如果我被各种琐事搞得晕头转向，被一些细微的变化分散了注意力，那我就会失败。我喜欢远离尘嚣，静下心来思考。真正的市场波动不会在开始的当天就结束。一场真正的市场波动需要时间才能结束。身处山中，我才能有足够的时间去思考这些波动。”（《股票交易指南》[格林维尔：交易者出版社，1991]，第32页）。Wyckoff echoed this sentiment when he wrote, “When in doubt do nothing. Don’t enter the market on half convictions; wait till the convictions are fully matured.” Wyckoff continued, “And so, whenever we feel these elements of uncertainty, either in our conclusions or in the positions we hold, let us clean house and become observers until, as that eminent trader Dickson G. Watts wrote, ‘The mind is clear; the judgment trustworthy”’ (Stock Market Technique Number 1 [New York: Richard D. Wyckoff, 1933], 51, 108).
威科夫也表达了类似的观点，他写道：“犹豫不决时，什么都不要做。不要凭着半吊子的信心进入市场；要等到你的信心完全成熟后再行动。”威科夫继续说道：“因此，每当我们感到这些不确定因素，无论是在我们的结论中还是在我们持有的立场中，让我们清理内部，成为观察者，直到，正如那位杰出的交易员迪克森·G·沃茨所写的那样，‘头脑清醒；判断可靠’”（《股票市场技巧第 1 号》[纽约：理查德·D·威科夫，1933 年]，第 51、108 页）。O’Neil acknowledges that there is a time when doing nothing is the best thing to do, and he is more specific about the symptoms: “It isn’t that bases, breakouts, or the method isn’t working anymore; it’s that the timing and the stocks are simply all wrong. The price and volume patterns are phony, faulty, and unsound. The general market is turning negative . . . Be patient, keep studying, and be 100 percent prepared” (How to Make Money in Stocks, 4th ed. [New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009], 151). Indeed, patience exercised wisely by staying out of the market when conditions are not right can save an investor a huge sum of money.
奥尼尔承认，有时最好的做法就是按兵不动，他对这种现象的症状做了更具体的描述：“并非是底部形态、突破形态或方法失效了；而是时机和选股都完全不对。价格和成交量模式是虚假的、错误的、不合理的。整体市场正在走下坡路……保持耐心，继续学习，做好万全准备”（《如何在股市赚钱》，第4版 [纽约：麦格劳-希尔出版社，2009]，151页）。的确，在市场行情不佳时，明智地保持耐心，远离市场，可以为投资者节省一大笔钱。



THE O’NEIL APPROACH: TECHNO-FUNDAMENTALISM 
奥尼尔方法：技术基本面主义O’Neil is often chided for being a “technician,” but anyone who truly understands the O’Neil methodology understands that it is in reality a “technofundamental” approach that combines the use of technical analysis to determine when a stock is under accumulation within a chart pattern and where the proper pivot buy point is on the one hand with essential fundamental characteristics of historically big, winning stocks on the other hand. Nicholas Darvas coined the term “techno-fundamental” to describe his system for investing in stocks, which combined monitoring the price action of a stock to determine that it was acting correctly within its “boxes” as well as to define buy points as a stock emerged from the top of a “box” with earnings growth as Darvas describes, “I saw that it is true that stocks are the slaves of earning power. Consequently I decided that while there may be many reasons behind any stock movement, I would look only for one: improving earnings power or anticipation of it. To do that, I would marry my technical approach to the fundamental one. I would select stocks on their technical action in the market, but I would only buy them when I could give improving earnings power as my fundamental reason for doing so” (How I Made $2 Million in the Stock Market [New York: Carol Publishing Group, 1998], 79).
奥尼尔经常被指责为“技术分析师”，但任何真正了解奥尼尔方法论的人都会明白，这实际上是一种“技术基本面”方法，它一方面结合了技术分析来确定股票在图表形态中何时处于积累阶段以及合适的枢轴买入点，另一方面结合了历史上表现优异的大股票的基本面特征。尼古拉斯·达瓦斯创造了“技术-基本面”一词来描述他的股票投资体系。该体系结合了对股票价格走势的监控，以确定其是否在其“区间”内正确运行，以及在股票突破“区间”顶部并结合盈利增长来确定买入点。正如达瓦斯所描述的：“我发现股票的确是盈利能力的奴隶。因此，我决定，尽管任何股票走势背后可能有很多原因，但我只会关注一个：盈利能力的提高或预期提高。为此，我将技术分析与基本面分析相结合。我会根据股票在市场上的技术表现来选择股票，但我只会在盈利能力提高这一基本面原因出现时才会买入”（《我如何在股市赚到200万美元》[纽约：卡罗尔出版集团，1998]，79）。O’Neil doesn’t just buy a stock just because it has a pretty chart—it must also exhibit the proper fundamental characteristics typical of winning stocks throughout history, according to O’Neil’s own studies of historical precedent.
奥尼尔并非仅仅因为某只股票的图表漂亮就买入——根据他对历史先例的研究，该股票还必须具备历史上成功股票所特有的基本面特征。



CONCLUSION 
结论After intensive study of multitudes of market cycles spanning over one hundred years, it is clear that O’Neil carries on and refines the conversation that Jesse Livermore, Richard Wyckoff, and Nicholas Darvas started. Human nature does not change, so we carry on the conversation, voicing our successes, failures, and findings—all of which carry deep learning both on analytical and psychological levels. This is not rocket science, and almost anyone can apply these methodologies to become successful in their own right, but the technique does require long-term focus and dedication. While we do not pretend to be equal to the stature of any of these gentlemen, we do believe that as former O’Neil portfolio managers and  as successful investors in our own right, using the O’Neil methodologies, we have something of value to add to the conversation. Certainly, as the markets continue to evolve, certain mechanics and applications of O’Neil methodologies will evolve as well, and it will be left up to traders like us to continue to evolve and improve our methods, but the basic philosophical foundation, the “ethos,” of the O’Neil methodologies will remain the same.
经过对一百多年来无数市场周期的深入研究，我们清楚地看到，奥尼尔延续并完善了杰西·利弗莫尔、理查德·威科夫和尼古拉斯·达瓦斯开启的对话。人性亘古不变，因此我们也应继续这场对话，分享我们的成功、失败和发现——所有这些都蕴含着分析和心理层面的深刻见解。这并非什么高深莫测的学问，几乎任何人都可以运用这些方法论获得成功，但这项技术确实需要长期的专注和投入。我们不敢自比这些先生们，但作为奥尼尔的前投资组合经理和运用奥尼尔方法论取得成功的投资者，我们相信我们能够为这场对话增添一些有价值的见解。当然，随着市场不断演变，奥尼尔方法论的某些机制和应用也会随之发展，而我们这些交易者也需要不断改进和完善我们的方法。但奥尼尔方法论的基本哲学基础，即其“精神内核”，将保持不变。
